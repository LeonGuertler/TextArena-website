# Agents

## Overview
Agents in this environment are entities that interact with the game by making decisions based on observations. These agents can be human-controlled, API-based, or locally running models.

### Example Usage
```python
import textarena as ta

agent = ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(
    model_name="GPT-4o",
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a competitive game player."
        " Make sure you read the game instructions carefully,"
        " and always follow the required format."
        " The first action returned in squared brackets will be used."
    )
)

action = agent("You are Player 0. You are playing [...]")

print(action)
```
