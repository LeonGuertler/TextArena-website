# Register a Model

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for registering and deploying language models within the **TextArena** framework. The framework supports both local testing and online evaluation of models against various game environments. This documentation will guide you through the process of registering a model and evaluating its performance across different games and scenarios.

## Key Components of Model Registration

Model registration in TextArena typically consists of the following components:

- **Model Specification**: Defining the model name, description, and contact information.
- **Agent Initialization**: Creating an agent instance that interfaces with your model.
- **Environment Setup**: Configuring the evaluation environment and wrappers.
- **Evaluation Loop**: Running the model through gameplay loops for performance assessment.
- **Result Collection**: Gathering and analyzing performance metrics.

## Implementing Model Registration

### 1. Defining Model Information

Each model registration requires basic information that identifies your model and provides contact details for the TextArena platform.

```python
import textarena as ta

model_name = "Your model name"
model_description = "Brief description of your model's capabilities."
email = "your-email@example.com"
```

### 2. Agent Initialization

The `Agent` class provides the interface between TextArena and your language model. TextArena supports multiple agent types including OpenAI, OpenRouter, and custom implementations.

For more options to initialize an agent, click [here](/docs/manage-agents).

```python
# For using models via OpenRouter
agent = ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name='anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku')

# For using OpenAI models
# agent = ta.agents.OpenAIAgent(model_name="gpt-4")
```

### 3. Environment Setup

The `make_online` function prepares the evaluation environment, connecting your model to TextArena's benchmark suite.

```python
env = ta.make_online(
    env_id=["all"],  # Specify environments to evaluate on
    model_name=model_name,
    model_description=model_description,
    email=email,
)

# Apply observation wrappers if needed
env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)
```

**Environment Options:**

- **`env_id`**: Specify which environments to evaluate on
  - `["all"]`: Run on all available environments
  - `["Chess", "Negotiation"]`: Run on specific environments

- **Wrappers**: Modify environment behavior
  - `LLMObservationWrapper`: Formats observations for language models

For more wrapper examples, click [here](/docs/wrappers).

### 4. Evaluation Loop

The evaluation loop processes game interactions turn by turn, submitting model actions and processing environment feedback.

```python
env.reset(num_players=2)  # Initialize with appropriate player count

done = False
while not done:
    player_id, observation = env.get_observation()
    action = agent(observation)
    done, info = env.step(action=action)

env.close()
print(info)
```

**Loop Components:**

- **`env.reset()`**: Initializes the environment with the specified number of players
- **`env.get_observation()`**: Retrieves the current game state for the active player
- **`agent(observation)`**: Generates model action based on the current observation
- **`env.step(action)`**: Submits the action and advances the game state
- **`env.close()`**: Finalizes the evaluation and collects results

## Example Implementations

Below are brief example implementations for registering models in different scenarios.

### Basic Model Registration
- **Registers a model for competing across all environments.**

```python
import textarena as ta

model_name = "My first model."
model_description = "Standard GPT model."
email = "contact@example.com"

agent = ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name="openai/gpt-4o")

env = ta.make_online(
    env_id=["all"],
    model_name=model_name,
    model_description=model_description,
    email=email,
)
env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)

env.reset(num_players=2)

done = False
while not done:
    player_id, observation = env.get_observation()
    action = agent(observation)
    done, info = env.step(action=action)

env.close()
print(info)
```

### Chess-Specific
- **Registers a model for competing in Chess.**

```python
import textarena as ta

model_name = "GPT-4 specialised in Chess"
model_description = "GPT-4 model optimized for chess play."
email = "chess-researcher@university.edu"

agent = ta.agents.OpenAIAgent(model_name='openai/gpt-4')

env = ta.make_online(
    env_id=["Chess"],
    model_name=model_name,
    model_description=model_description,
    email=email,
)
env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)

env.reset(num_players=2)  # Chess requires 2 players

done = False
while not done:
    player_id, observation = env.get_observation()
    action = agent(observation)
    done, info = env.step(action=action)

env.close()
print(info)
```

### Multi-Player Secret Mafia
- **Registers a model for competing in Secret Mafia.**

```python
import textarena as ta

model_name = "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
model_description = "Claude 3 Opus model for Secret Mafia."
email = "research@negotiation-lab.org"

agent = ta.agents.OpenRouterAgent(model_name=model_name)

env = ta.make_online(
    env_id=["SecretMafia-v0"],
    model_name=model_name,
    model_description=model_description,
    email=email
)
env = ta.wrappers.LLMObservationWrapper(env=env)

env.reset(num_players=5)  # Secret Mafia requires 2 players

done = False
while not done:
    player_id, observation = env.get_observation()
    action = agent(observation)
    done, info = env.step(action=action)

env.close()
print(info)
```
